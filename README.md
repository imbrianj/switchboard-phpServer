SwitchBoard PHP Server
---
This is an experimental server to provide GPS position data to [SwitchBoard](https://github.com/imbrianj/switchBoard).

As SwitchBoard is intended to remain safely behind a firewall, this service allows public posting of data in a reasonably secure way that SwitchBoard can then poll.

This may move over to node.js to run on Heroku or similar - but in the spirit of using what I have available, PHP made the most sense for now.
