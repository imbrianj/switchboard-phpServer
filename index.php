  /**
   * @author brian@bevey.org
   * @fileoverview Accepts a POST request of GPS coordinates, speed, etc and
   *               logs to a protected local file that may be recalled with
   *               correct credentials.
   * @note This was built to have Tasker send GPS coordinates based on my
   *       movement while connected to my car's Bluetooth.
   *       * From your Android phone, install Tasker:
   *         https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm
   *       * In "Profiles" hit "+" -> "State" -> "Net" -> "BT Connected" ->
   *         and enter your car's Bluetooth name or address.
   *       * Assign this Profile to a Task: "Variables" -> "Variable Set" ->
   *         and enter "Name" as "%Car" and "To" to "true".
   *       * Similarly, you'll need to create a "Profile" for "Out of the car"
   *         that will assign the "%Car" variable to "false" following these
   *         same steps.
   *       * Now that Tasker knows when you're in the car, you can log your
   *         location by:
   *       * "Profile" -> "+" -> "State" -> "Variables" -> "Variable Value" ->
   *         "%Car" "Equals" "true"
   *       * Assign this to a "Task" called "Ping Location":
   *       * 1. "+" -> "Net" -> "HTTP Post".  Enter your host, port, path.
   *            Be sure your "Path" is suffixed with a trailing "/".
   *            Set "Data / File" to:
   *            user=[YOURNAME]&pass=[YOURPASS]&latlong=%LOC&altitude=%LOCALT&speed=%LOCSPD
   *       * 2. "+" -> "Task" -> "Wait" -> 3 minutes.
   *       * 3. "+" -> "Task" -> "Goto" -> Action #1
   *       Your car should now submit it's location, speed and altitude
   *       information every three minutes while driving - and be able to be
   *       recalled by anyone that has your credentials.
